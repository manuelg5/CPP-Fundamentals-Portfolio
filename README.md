# CPP-Fundamentals-Portfolio

About

This repository contains my C++ projects from my Associate’s program in Computer Science at Tarrant County College (TCC).
The projects focus on learning the basics of C++ such as arrays, file input/output, sorting, and menu-driven programs.

Projects
Student Grades Manager

Reads student names and grades from a file. Lets the user view averages, maximums, and minimums with letter grades.

- Concepts: File I/O, 2D arrays, functions, menu.

Speakers’ Bureau

Stores information about speakers (name, phone, topic, fee). User can enter and list data. Includes input validation.

- Concepts: Structs, arrays, menu programs, validation.

Rainfall Statistics

Reads rainfall data for 12 months, finds average, min, and max, then sorts results in descending order.
