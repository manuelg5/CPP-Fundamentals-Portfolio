# Rainfall Statistics

This C++ program analyzes rainfall data for the twelve months of the year. It reads monthly rainfall totals from a file (rainfall.txt), calculates yearly statistics, and sorts the results for easy viewing.

The project demonstrates file input/output, arrays, parallel arrays, bubble sort, and formatted console output in C++.

✨ Features

- 🌧️ File Input: Reads 12 rainfall values (one per month) from a text file.

- 📆 Parallel Arrays: Keeps month names and rainfall values aligned while processing and sorting.

- ➗ Average Calculation: Computes the average rainfall across the year.

- 🔻 Minimum Rainfall: Finds the month with the lowest rainfall and displays its value.

- 🔝 Maximum Rainfall: Finds the month with the highest rainfall and displays its value.

- ↕️ Bubble Sort: Sorts the rainfall values in descending order while keeping the month names in sync.

- 📊 Formatted Output: Displays the minimum, maximum, average, and a neatly aligned table of sorted rainfall results (two decimal places).
