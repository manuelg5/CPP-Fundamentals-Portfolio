# Student-Grade-Calculator


This C++ program manages student grade data from a file and allows users to interactively analyze the results. It reads student names and their five grades from a file (NamesGrades.txt), then provides multiple options to display statistics such as averages, maximums, and minimums, along with corresponding letter grades.

The project demonstrates file processing, arrays, functions, and user interaction via a menu system in C++.

✨ Features:

- 📂 File Handling: Reads student names and grades from a text file.
- 👨‍🎓 Parallel Arrays: Maintains student names and grades in parallel structures.
- ➗ Average Calculation: Computes the average grade for each student.
- 🔝 Maximum Grade: Displays the highest grade each student achieved.
- 🔻 Minimum Grade: Displays the lowest grade each student achieved.
- 🎓 Letter Grades: Converts numerical grades into letter grades (A–F).
