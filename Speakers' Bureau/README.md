# Speakers'-Bureau



This C++ program manages a simple Speakers’ Bureau database. It allows users to enter and display information for five speakers. Each record stores a speaker’s name, phone number, speaking topic, and fee required. The program uses a struct to represent each speaker and an array of structures to manage the records.

The project demonstrates the use of structures, arrays, input validation, and a menu-driven user interface in C++.
